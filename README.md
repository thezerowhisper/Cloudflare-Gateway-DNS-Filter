# Cloudflare Gateway DNS Filter — Block + Allow

> Pihole-style DNS ad blocking using Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust, with a dedicated Allow rule that takes precedence over blocking.

`For Devs, Ops, and everyone who hates Ads.`

## How it works

This script manages two sets of Cloudflare Gateway DNS rules in a single workflow run:

| Rule | Action | Precedence | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[AdBlock-DNS-Filters] Block Ads` | block | 1000 | `adlist.ini` + `dynamic_blacklist.txt` |
| `[AdAllow-DNS-Filters] Allow` | allow | 999 *(higher priority)* | `whitelist.ini` + `dynamic_whitelist.txt` |
| `[AdBlock-DNS-Filters] Block Ads (SNI)` *(optional)* | block | 1000 | Reuses the block list above |

Because the Allow rule has a **lower precedence number** (999 < 1000), Cloudflare evaluates it first — so whitelisted domains are always resolved even if they appear in a blocklist. There is no need to subtract the whitelist from the block list in code.

The script also enforces Cloudflare Gateway's **free tier limit of 300 lists** across both rules combined. If your sources would require more than 300 lists, the script stops before making any changes.

## (Optional) SNI-based blocking — resist DNS bypass

Plain DNS filtering has a blind spot: if a device or app ignores your DNS server (uses its own DNS-over-HTTPS, or connects straight to an IP), it can dodge the filter entirely.

SNI (Server Name Indication) is the domain name sent in cleartext during the TLS handshake, before the connection is encrypted. Enabling SNI filtering makes Gateway inspect that handshake directly instead of relying on DNS — so even if a device bypasses DNS, the connection to a blocked domain still gets cut.

**To enable it:**

1. Set the environment variable / Actions variable `ENABLE_SNI_FILTER` to `true`.
2. In the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, go to **Settings → Network** and enable **Gateway proxy for TCP**. Without this, the rule exists but has no effect.
3. Devices must connect through the **WARP client** (Gateway with WARP mode) — just pointing DNS at Cloudflare is not enough for this rule to see the traffic.

The SNI rule reuses the same domain lists as the DNS block rule, so it doesn't consume any extra list quota.

## Setup

### 1. Fork this repository

### 2. Get your Cloudflare credentials

- **Account ID** — found in the URL after `https://dash.cloudflare.com/`:
  `https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers`

- **API Token** — create at `https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens` with these 3 permissions:
  1. `Account › Zero Trust : Edit`
  2. `Account › Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit`
  3. `Account › Access: Apps and Policies : Edit`

### 3. Add Repository Secrets

Go to `https://github.com/<username>/Cloudflare-Gateway-DNS-Filter/settings/secrets/actions` and add:

| Secret | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | Your Cloudflare API Token |
| `CF_IDENTIFIER` | Your Cloudflare Account ID |

### 4. Configure your lists

**Block list** — edit [`lists/adlist.ini`](./lists/adlist.ini):
```ini
[Ad-Urls]
Adguard = https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```

**Allow list** — edit [`lists/whitelist.ini`](./lists/whitelist.ini):
```ini
[Allow-Urls]
MyAllow = https://example.com/my-whitelist.txt
```

Both files accept plain URLs (one per line) or the `[Section] key = url` INI format.

### 5. (Optional) Add lists via GitHub Actions Variables

Go to `https://github.com/<username>/Cloudflare-Gateway-DNS-Filter/settings/variables/actions` and add:

| Name | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ADLIST_URLS` | Space-separated block list URLs |
| `WHITELIST_URLS` | Space-separated allow list URLs |
| `DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST` | Extra domains to block (one per line) |
| `DYNAMIC_WHITELIST` | Extra domains to allow (one per line) |
| `ENABLE_SNI_FILTER` | Set to `true` to enable the extra SNI-based block rule (see section above) |

* You should add your ad list and whitelist to Action variables. If you update your fork, your custom list will not be lost.

---

## Supported list formats

```
# Plain URL
https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```
```ini
# INI format
[Ad-Urls]
Adguard = https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```

Supported domain list styles: hosts files, AdBlock/uBlock syntax, plain domain lists.

> **Note:** Use **DNS filter lists**, not browser extension filter lists. Browser lists contain cosmetic rules that cause errors when used as DNS blocklists.

## How to set up using Termux?

To use this tool on the **GOAT** [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest), follow the steps below. If you are already familiar with setting up Python and the basics, you can skip this section.

#### Method 1:

1. Open Termux and run the following commands one by one:

```sh
yes | pkg upgrade
yes | pkg install python-pip
yes | pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Cloudflare-Gateway-DNS-Filter.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository folder:

```sh
cd Cloudflare-Gateway-DNS-Filter
```

3. Edit the `.env` file (required):

```sh
nano .env
```

After editing, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `ENTER` to save the file.

4. Run the command to upload (update) your DNS list:

```sh
python -m src run
```

5. Run the command to delete your DNS list:

```sh
python -m src leave
```

#### Method 2:

1. Download the ZIP file of the repository from the 'Code' button on the GitHub page and select 'Download ZIP'.

2. Unzip the downloaded file.

3. Edit the values in `.env`, `lists/adlist.ini`, `lists/whitelist.ini` etc...

4. Open Termux and enter the following commands to set up Python and necessary tools:

```sh
yes | pkg upgrade
yes | pkg install python-pip
termux-setup-storage
```

5. Allow Termux to access storage.

6. Navigate to the folder containing the unzipped source code:

```sh
cd storage/downloads/Cloudflare-Gateway-DNS-Filter-main
```

7. Run the command to upload (update) your DNS list:

```sh
python -m src run
```

8. Run the command to delete your DNS list:

```sh
python -m src leave
```

If you encounter issues during setup, you can refer to [termux-change-repo](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management) for changing Termux repositories.

## Note

* The **limit** of `Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust` free is **300 lists** (block + allow combined), with 1,000 domains per list — up to **300,000 domains** total. The script stops automatically if this limit would be exceeded.

* If you have uploaded lists using another script, you should delete them using the delete feature of that script or delete them manually.

* To delete all lists and rules created by this script, go to [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) and change the command:

```yml
      - name: Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust
        run: python -m src leave
```
